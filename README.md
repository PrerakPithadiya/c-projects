# C Projects

This repository contains a collection of C projects demonstrating various programming concepts and techniques. Each project is self-contained and includes a brief description of its functionality.

## Projects

### 1. Tic Tac Toe
A console-based Tic Tac Toe game featuring player versus computer gameplay with two difficulty levels: Human (Standard) and God (Impossible). The game uses ANSI color codes for a colorful interface and implements the Minimax algorithm for unbeatable AI.

### 2. Sudoku Solver
A program that solves Sudoku puzzles using a backtracking algorithm. It includes a colorful console output to display the Sudoku grid before and after solving.

### 3. Progress Bar
A demonstration of a progress bar with multiple tasks. The progress bar updates in real-time and includes a rotating spinner animation for visual feedback.

### 4. Number Guessing Game
A number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game includes different difficulty levels and provides feedback on each guess.

### 5. Kaun Banega Crorepati
A console-based implementation of the popular quiz game "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). The game features multiple-choice questions, lifelines, time limits, and colorful console output.

### 6. Digital Clock
A digital clock that displays the current time in either 12-hour or 24-hour format. The clock updates every second and uses ANSI escape codes for colored output.

### 7. Bank Management System
A simple bank management system that allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw money, and check account balances. The account data is stored in a binary file for persistence.

## How to Run

Each project can be compiled and run individually. For example, to compile and run the Tic Tac Toe game:

```sh
gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe
./tic_tac_toe
```

Follow similar steps for other projects, replacing `tic_tac_toe.c` with the respective source file name.

## Dependencies

- GCC compiler
- ANSI-compatible terminal for colored output
